# Design Patterns in Golang

## Builder Pattern

This pattern allows you to create complex objects step by step, we deconstruct the object into several parts, reducing its constructor args and making it easier to understand how the object is built

## Factory Pattern

This pattern provides an interface and allows you to modify the implementations of that interface according to the object that was created

## Singleton Pattern

This pattern creates a single instance of a class/object and allows the entire application to modify it (it's a single instance that is consumed in multiple places)
